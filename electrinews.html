<h2>Android Oreo</h2>
<p><img class="small" src="oreo.jpg" alt="HP Laptops"/></p>
    
<p>Google pulled off one of the best marketing stunts in history on Monday, by taking advantage of the solar eclipse to announce a cool name for Android O. Android 8.0 is now officially known as Oreo, but as awesome as that may be, the sad fact is that most devices will not get it anytime soon. Unless you own a Pixel- or Nexus-branded gadget, then you’ll have to wait a while longer to get your hands on Oreo.That said, if you happen to rock one of the Google devices that can run Android 8.0, then you should know Google already posted on its Android Developers blog the download links for Oreo.
    If you have a google pixel then you can upgrade to android O.</p>

<p><img class="small" src="google.jpg" alt="Apple Macbooks"/></p>
    <p>A blogger with an accurate record, Evan Blass, said this week that Google will unveil its new smartphone on Oct. 5.
The Google Pixel 2 is expected to succeed the original Pixel and will be among the first new smartphones that will run Google's new Android Oreo operating system, which was officially launched this week.
The Pixel 2 will reportedly operate on Qualcomm's brand new Snapdragon 836 processor, which would make it among the most powerful smartphones on the market. The device is expected to look like last year's model instead of packing an edge-to-edge screen, which has become a trend among new smartphones.</p>

<h2>Ryzen 3 vs Core i5-2500K</h2>
<p><img class="small" src="core.jpg" alt="HP Laptops"/></p>
    <p>At this point we know that Ryzen 3 makes a strong case for budget gaming compared to Intel's Kaby Lake-based Pentium G4560 and Core i5-7400 as well as AMD's own Ryzen 5 1400...
What we've yet to learn, however, is whether that scenario changes with overclocking and if folks with older high-end chips such as the Core i5-2500K and FX-8370 have anything to see here.
Codenamed Sandy Bridge, the second-generation Core architecture was released way back in early 2011 and may represent Intel's most impressive enthusiast processor series of the last decade.</p>

<p><img class="small" src="spotify.jpg" alt="Asus Laptops"/></p>
    <P>Spotify has signed a new licensing deal with Warner Music Group, paving the way for the music streaming service to go public.
Warner was the last of the three big record labels to agree to renewed terms to make its catalogue available to Spotify's 140 million users.
However, Spotify has been forced to agree to some limitations to get the labels to sign.Artists and labels have in the past complained about minuscule revenue from steaming sites when compared to downloads or physical sales.But with the deals with Sony, Universal and now Warner in place, Spotify is expected to float on the New York Stock Exchange as early as this year.</P>
